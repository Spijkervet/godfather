## Introduction

The Godfather script's name comes from an early SA-MP gamemode.
I thought it was a nice idea to bring the nostalgia back in GTA:V and decided to rework the original idea into a new gamemode for GTA:Network.


Features

"Dynamic" means it can be altered within the game by Game Admins (so without touching code.)

## Characters
You can create multiple characters within one account. All character data is stored on a character-level, not on the account.  

1. A character can hold administrator privileges.  
2. A character can join a group (see below what groups are).  
3. Characters can own properties.  
4. Characters can own vehicles.  



## Groups

A character can join or be invited to a group. Groups can be anything ranging from a faction, gang, business, organization, anything! Groups can also have an "Extra Type". For example, a food store business has the "business" type, and the "food store" extra type. Group types and extra types can be dynamically allocated. There are 9 pre-defined group types that have scripted commands associated to them:

Law Enforcement Agency  
Military  
Medical Department  
Correctional Facility  
Hitman Agency  
Taxi Cab Company  
News Network  
Criminal Organization  
Business  

Communication is done through a portable or department radio.  
A group has a rank and division system. There are unlimited ranks and divisions.  
Vehicles can be assigned to a group.  
Properties can be assigned to a group.  


## Properties
Properties can be owned by a character or a group. There are three property types:

## House
Door  
Building  

Houses and buildings can hold items, like weapons, ammo, drugs and other rare goods. A group's assets are calculated by how much is available in their properties. For example: If a player owns one group (e.g. "WallyMart", type business, extra type Food Market), they can own multiple properties (buildings) that all have different levels of stock. The challenge for "Wally" is to take care of his properties' sales and stock, so business' revenue is guaranteed.


## Vehicles

Vehicles can be owned by a character or a group. Each vehicle has a trunk storage, in which items, weapons, ammo, drugs and other rare goods can be stored.

## Web Control Panel
The web control panel is made with the open source AdminLTE theme. Nothing new :=)  
The web interface allows you to:  
Display your account's statistics  
View your characters  
Manage accounts / characters.  
Manage groups  
Manage properties
